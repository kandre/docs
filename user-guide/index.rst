QWAT User Guide
===============

This represents a guide on how to collect data in QWAT (digitizing), edit existing data and use various tools.

The QGIS 3 documentation is available `here <https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual>`_.

When opening the QGIS projet, a message about macros may appear. In order to use QWAT properly, you must activate macro in your QGIS configuration. Since QWAT have a lot of triggers and relations, some actions are generated with python in QGIS by using these macros.
